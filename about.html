        <p class="infoParagraph">The Kyoto Sustainability Collaboration started in 2021 to help connect small sustainable organizations with filmmakers to benefit both parties. For small organizations, videos created in this collaboration can be used for promotion of their cause. For filmmakers, filmmaking experience is often needed for students moving into the professional world. Hobbyists who simply enjoy the art of creating these projects can have a topic to focus on that they can feel good about.</p>
        <p class="infoParagraph">The Kyoto Sustainability Collaboration started as a project between Chuck Kayser of Midori Farm and Sam Parks, Micah Wilde, Julian Poindexter, and Jackson Sypek. Special thanks to Raj Joshi, Chris Pond, Melissa Belz, and Jennifer deWinter for their continued support of the project.</p>
